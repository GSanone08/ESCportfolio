	  <h3>Making The Skyline Tennis Team</h3>
	  <p>This year as a freshmen I was starting to play with the team during the summer, I was just getting to know everyone. During tryouts I got nervous and wasn't playing my best and lost every single match, they were all really close but not wins. I was so upset, but luckily my mom was there to tell me that it will be okay. The tennis team at Skyline doesn't do cuts but I was worried that I would get placed in a spot that I shouldn't be at, the day that we found out what spot we got was a stressful day. I looked at my phone to see the message and I made #2 JV singles. I was so happy, for the rest of the season I alternated between #2 singles and #3 singles and I was able to go to regions and win the #3 singles division.</p>
